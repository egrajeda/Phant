# Phant v1.0

Phant is an enhaced PHP command line interface.

In the normal PHP CLI you would do:

    php> var_dump(4 + 4);

to see the result. In Phant you can do:

    > 4 + 4

You can use Phant to debug tiny pieces of code. Note that you can write
multi-line statements and step through code with phant;

To start Phant, run:

    php phant.php
    
    php phant.php -c
    
The -c will run phant in colorized mode. You may also want to add this to your
path so that it can be run with a simpler command.
